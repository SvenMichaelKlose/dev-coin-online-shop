    - can be set up by web designers who know next to nothing
      about programming

    - inventory and templates are in the administration area
    - categories can be nested as much as you like

History
=======

dev/coin has been developed from 2000 til 2002 by Sven Michael Klose
at dev/consulting GmbH (Bielefeld, Germany) and it has been released
under the GNU Public License in 2001. When dev/consulting GmbH was
sold, dev/coin has been wiped off the servers and was believed to be
gone forever. In November the 25th, 2011 it has been rediscovered.

Future
======

Still, it's an interesting piece of software than can be very useful
and so we're going to get it up and running on PHP5. Also, we need
to upgrade it use the newest version of Caroshi PHP.
