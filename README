NOTE: At the time dev/coin is broken.


What's this?
============


This is dev/coin, a free web shop written in PHP.  It depends on
the application framework "Caroshi PHP" which can be found here:

    https://github.com/SvenMichaelKlose/Caroshi-PHP

For the lastest version of dev/coin, please see

    https://github.com/SvenMichaelKlose/dev-coin-online-shop


What can I do with it?
======================


You can set up an small online shop. Products are placed in
categories or subcategories and can have variants.  Orders are
sent via e-mail.  The inventory is edited in a private area
online.

dev/coin is very search-engine friendly. To the outside world the
shop looks like the pages aren't dynamically generated.

You can edit the design template as HTML online for each category
or product.  No programming experience is required and you don't
need to tweak any files on the web server once the shop has been
configured and uploaded.  Every configuration item, like design
templares or the e-mail address orders are sent to can be changed
for every category or product, so you can share the shop with
others.

Professional support is available.

In case you do have PHP programming experience you'll find that
the source can be extended easily.  You may choose to share or
not share the changes you made.


Where can I see it in action?
=============================


Currently nowhere.  http://kendog.de is planned to run with
dev/coin again once it's been repaired.  If you're brimming with
impatience visit

How do I install it?
====================


Change the MySQL database account information in file
'config.php' to fit your web server.  Upload it onto your web
server and open directory 'admin' in your web browser.  The shop
should be up and running with a default design.


History
=======


dev/coin has been developed from 2000 til 2002 by Sven Michael
Klose at dev/consulting GmbH (Bielefeld, Germany) and it has
been released under the GNU Public License in 2001.  When
dev/consulting GmbH was sold, dev/coin has been wiped off the
servers and was believed to be gone forever.  In November 2011
it has been rediscovered.


Future
======


Still, it's an interesting piece of software than can be very
useful and so we're going to get it up and running with the
newest version of Caroshi PHP.
