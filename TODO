Inheritance of objects into subdirectories is key of this
software's design.  Classes of objects are key to a user- friendly
editor.  Regular files are required to store complex templates.

We'll use the object mechanism to store product information, but
we'll place templates into "template directories" that can be
filled with freely baptizeable files.

Make it look nice
=================

Replace inlined HTML styles in admin area by class names.
