    Since the shop runs quite stable, the user manual is rewritten and the
    user interface comes to usability ;) it's time to do a 1.0.0 release
    and clean up the CMS before working on the next stable branch.

    This are the features suggested for the 1.2.0 release:

    - Merged directory table; a cursor would only contain an integer.
    - XML style tags (no need for separate list templates and a good way to
      pass multiple attributes).

    This are the features suggested for any later release:

    Directory objects:

	- Let user the lifetime of objects.
	- Add resort object to split the shop.

    Cart:

	- Add user defineable form fields.

    Admin-Interface:

	- Let user move records in a list and across lists.
	- Syntax highlighting for tags.
	- Fulltext search over objects.
	- Usermanagement

    Configuration:

        - Use different db users for more security.
	- Option: don't store customer related data if mail was sent.
